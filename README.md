## API

### topicExtraction(text, options)

Extracts topics from input text using LDA.

#### Parameters

- `text` (string): The input text to analyze
- `options` (object):
  - `numTopics` (number, optional): Number of topics to extract. Default: 2
  - `numTerms` (number, optional): Number of terms per topic. Default: 5

#### Returns

Returns a Promise that resolves to the LDA analysis result.

## About LDA

LDA is an unsupervised learning method that discovers topics in text documents. It views documents as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.
