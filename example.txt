**What is Lorcana?**

Lorcana is an enchanting and immersive collectible card game (CCG) developed by Ravensburger in collaboration with Disney. Set in a magical world called the **Great Illuminary**, Lorcana invites players to step into the role of **Illumineers**, powerful sorcerers who can wield the power of Disney’s most beloved characters, artifacts, and songs. Using the magic of **ink**—the substance that brings these characters to life—Illumineers summon allies, harness spells, and engage in strategic duels to unlock the mysteries of the Great Illuminary.

The game features **vividly illustrated cards** of iconic Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Elsa, Stitch, and Moana, reimagined in stunning art styles that add new depth and creativity to the characters we all know and love. Each card belongs to one of six "ink colors" (Amber, Amethyst, Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, and Steel), which represent different playstyles and strategies, offering endless possibilities for deck-building and tactical gameplay.
